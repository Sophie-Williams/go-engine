protocol for talking to engine:
  -- making moves: upcase letter A-T followed by number 1-19 eg 'A19'
  -- to resign: downcase letter 'r' followed by 0
  -- to pass: letter '-', followed by 0
  -- After double pass, send list of positions to remove (removing one position removes entire strictly connected chain)
